# Blind Watermark

A **blind watermark** in this project means the watermark embedded in the image 1) is invisible, 2) can be extracted without the original image and 3) is an image or a sequence of numbers. I plan to implement some blind watermarking methods in this project.

## method1

The algorithm in the folder method1 comes from the paper Blind image watermarking technique based on differential embedding in DWT and DCT domains. Only the DCT-only method in this paper is implemented.

## method2

The algorithm in the folder method2 comes from the paper Blocked DCT and Quantization Based Blind Image Watermark Algorithm.
