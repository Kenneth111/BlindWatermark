# Blind Watermark

A **blind watermark** in this project means the watermark embedded in the image 1) is invisible and 2) can be extracted without the original image. I plan to implement some blind watermarking methods in this project.

## method1

The algorithm in the folder method1 comes from the paper Blind image watermarking technique based on differential embedding in DWT and DCT domains. Only the DCT-only method in this paper is implemented.
